### Background

Flow cytometry measures the abundance, relative size, and pigment fluorescence of phytoplankton cells using a blue laser shining on a narrow stream of water. Phytoplankton populations are identified by forward scatter (relative size), red fluorescence (chlorophyll), and orange fluorescence (phycoerythrin) [! Gated cytograms](HOT297_snapshot_cytogram.pdf).



In this project, we use data from the [SeaFlow](https://seaflow.netlify.app/) flow cytometer on the [HOT-297](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/) cruise at Station ALOHA in the North Pacific. Populations are identified by unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithms.
